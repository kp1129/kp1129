### Hi there 👋

I'm Katya and I'm a software engineer. I know enough to be dangerous across the stack, but most of my work tends to be on the frontend. I'm a huge fan of the React ecosystem, and I'm always learning something new. 

- 🔭 I’m currently building React/Gatsby applets
- 🌱 I’m exploring frontend animations (animate.css, GSAP, etc)
- ⚡ In the near future I'm going to dive into React Native
