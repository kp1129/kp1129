### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Katya and I'm a software engineer. I tend to work on the frontend, and I know enough to be dangerous across the stack (including devops). I'm a huge fan of the React ecosystem, and I'm always learning something new. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building React/Gatsby applets
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m exploring Next.js
- âš¡ In the near future I'm going to dive into React Native
