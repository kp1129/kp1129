### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Katya and I'm a software engineer. My specialty is fullstack development with React on the frontend and Node on the backend. My academic background is in psychology, and I care deeply about user experience at every step of the way.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on fullstack apps
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Material UI (and loving it!)
- âš¡ Up next I'd like to explore Typescript
